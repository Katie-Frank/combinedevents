## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version, I have:

* Removed the acronym 'IAAF' from the description field of the DESCRIPTION file.
* Added references in the description field of the DESCRIPTION file in the form authors (year) <https:...>. There is no doi, arXiv, or ISBN for the source I reference, so that is why I use <https::...>.
